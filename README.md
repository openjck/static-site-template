# static-site-template

static-site-template is a template for static websites which are deployed to
[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). It uses
[Parcel](https://github.com/parcel-bundler/parcel) to optimize assets and
includes support for [TypeScript](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript),
[ESLint](https://github.com/eslint/eslint),
[Stylelint](https://github.com/stylelint/stylelint),
[Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier), and
[Google Analytics](https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/). I
haven't found an HTML linter that I like, but I welcome suggestions.

(Netlify can optimize assets on its own, but using Parcel makes this template
more portable to other hosts.)

I mainly created this template for my own use, but it might also be a nice
foundation for your static site. If you don't plan to use Netlify or Google
Analytics (or TypeScript or ESLint or whatever) you can easily remove support
for them.

## Usage

To create a new project based on this template, run the following:

```sh
npx degit openjck/static-site-template static-site
rm static-site/UNLICENSE static-site/README.md
```
