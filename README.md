# static-site-template

A simple template for my static sites using Parcel and Netlify. (Yes, Netlify
could automatically optimize assets, but this is more portable to other hosts.)

This template is shared under the terms of the
[Unlicense](https://unlicense.org). If you do not wish to apply the Unlicense to
a project which uses this template, be sure to remove the `UNLICENSE` file. You
may also want to remove this `README.md` file.
