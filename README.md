# static-site-template

static-site-template is the template that I use to build static sites which are
deployed to Netlify. It uses Parcel to optimize assets and includes support for
TypeScript, ESLint, Stylelint, Prettier, and Google Analytics.

(Netlify _can_ automatically optimize assets, but using Parcel makes this
template more portable to other hosts.)

This template is mainly meant for my own use, but it may also serve as a nice
foundation for your project. If you do not intend to use Netlify or Google
Analytics (or TypeScript or ESLint or whatever) you can easily remove support
for those tools.

This template is shared under the terms of the
[Unlicense](https://unlicense.org). If you do not wish to apply the Unlicense to
a project which uses this template, be sure to remove the _UNLICENSE_ file. You
may also want to remove this _README.md_ file.
